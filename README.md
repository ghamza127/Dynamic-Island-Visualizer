#  Dynamic Island Visualizer

> **A sleek, minimalist, and high-performance audio-reactive visualizer for Spicetify, inspired by the iPhone's Dynamic Island call interface.**

##  Key Features

* **Adaptive Color Engine**: Uses a robust "Dribbblish-style" canvas extraction method to grab colors directly from album art. It bypasses broken APIs and includes a "darkness check" to ensure visibility on all tracks.
* **Pro Physics Engine**: Features **Asymmetric Physics** with a snappy "Fast Attack" (upward movement) and a smooth, gravity-based "Decay" (downward movement).
* **Rhythmic Beat-Sync**: Taps into Spotify's internal `AudioAnalysis` to pulse in sync with the song's actual beats, tatums, and loudness segments.
* **GPU Optimized**: Utilizes hardware-accelerated CSS transforms (`scaleY`) and `will-change` hints for smooth 60fps performance without taxing your CPU.
* **Zero-Dependency**: Works perfectly on vanilla Spotify. No specific themes or external CSS frameworks required.
